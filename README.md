2. Tap "New Route" 
3. Enter route name and addresses
4. Set start and end points on the map
5. Save the route

### 2. Tracking Journeys
1. Select a route from the Routes tab
2. Go to the "Track" tab
3. Tap "Start Tracking" to begin recording
4. The app will track your location, speed, and detect speed bumps
5. Tap "Stop Tracking" when you reach your destination

### 3. Viewing Analytics
1. Navigate to the "Analytics" tab
2. Select "All Routes" for comparison or specific route for details
3. View performance metrics, charts, and insights
4. Analyze traffic patterns and route efficiency

### 4. Settings & Data Management
1. Go to "Settings" tab
2. Configure tracking preferences
3. Manage location permissions
4. Export or clear data as needed
5. Toggle community data sharing

## Key Components

### Context Providers
- **LocationContext**: Manages GPS tracking and location services
- **RouteContext**: Handles route data, sessions, and analytics

### Core Services
- **DatabaseService**: SQLite database operations and data persistence
- **Crowd-sourced data management**: Community data aggregation

### Screen Components
- **HomeScreen**: Dashboard with overview and recent activity
- **RouteSelectionScreen**: Route creation and selection interface
- **TrackingScreen**: Real-time journey tracking with sensor integration
- **AnalyticsScreen**: Comprehensive analytics and route comparison
- **SettingsScreen**: App configuration and data management

## Data Privacy

- Location data is stored locally on your device by default
- Community data sharing is optional and anonymous
- No personal information is collected or shared
- You can export or delete all data at any time

## Performance Considerations

- GPS accuracy depends on device capabilities and environment
- Speed bump detection sensitivity can be adjusted
- Background tracking may impact battery life
- Large datasets are optimized for performance

## Contributing

This app is designed to be extensible. Key areas for enhancement:
- Additional sensor integration (gyroscope, magnetometer)
- Machine learning for traffic prediction
- Integration with external traffic services
- Advanced route optimization algorithms
- Social features and route sharing

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
1. GPS coordinates ‚Üí Location Context
2. Accelerometer data ‚Üí Speed bump detection algorithm
3. Route tracking ‚Üí Session recording
4. Analytics computation ‚Üí Insights generation
5. Community data ‚Üí Aggregated traffic patterns

### Database Schema
- Routes table with geographic coordinates
- Sessions table with journey metadata
- Points table with GPS tracking data
- Speed bumps table with detection data
- Traffic data table with crowd-sourced information

### Sensor Integration
- **Accelerometer**: Magnitude-based speed bump detection
- **GPS**: High-frequency location tracking
- **Device motion**: Road surface analysis

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Location not detected**
   - Ensure location permissions are granted
   - Check GPS signal strength
   - Try restarting location services

2. **Speed bump detection not working**
   - Verify device has accelerometer
   - Check sensitivity settings
   - Ensure app has motion permissions

3. **Performance issues**
